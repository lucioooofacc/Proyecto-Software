                Minecraft is a game where everything is made of blocks, but those blocks let you create entire worlds. At first, it looks simple (trees, dirt, stone, animals), but once you start playing, you realize how endless it actually is. You can explore giant caves, build huge castles, survive the night against zombies and skeletons, or just relax farming and decorating your little house. <br><br>
                What makes Minecraft special is the freedom. There's no single way to play it. Some people focus on adventure, gearing up to fight the Ender Dragon, while others spend hours designing cities, machines, or pixel art. It's almost like a mix of survival, creativity, and imagination all in one. <br><br>
                And honestly, that's why it's still so popular after all these years. Every world feels personal, every creation feels like yours, and you always end up finding something new to do. For us, it's not just a game; it's like a sandbox where you can build your own story, block by block.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align:left; color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; margin-right:50px;">
                Is one of the most influential video games ever created. It was first developed in 2009 by Markus Persson, known as Notch, who began working on a simple block-based building game. The concept was unique: players could explore a world made entirely of blocks, break them, and place them again to create their own structures and environments.<br><br>
                Over time, new features were added, such as Survival Mode, where players must gather resources and face hostile creatures like zombies, skeletons, and the now iconic Creeper. Other major additions included the Nether dimension, the End dimension with the Ender Dragon, and later updates that introduced new biomes, animals, and mechanics.
                The game was officially released in 2011, but it had already gained enormous popularity through its community and content creators on platforms like YouTube. Videos, music parodies, and “Let's Plays” helped Minecraft become a cultural phenomenon.<br><br>
                In 2014, Mojang, the studio behind the game, was acquired by Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars. While this sparked some concerns among fans, the game continued to grow. Since then, it has received numerous updates, introducing features such as bees, axolotls, the Warden, and caves and cliffs that completely changed world generation.
                Today, Minecraft is the best-selling videogame in history. It is available on nearly every platform, from computers to consoles and even mobile devices. Beyond being a game, it has become a space for creativity, education, and community, inspiring millions of players worldwide.<br><br>
                For us, as teenagers who have grown up playing Minecraft, it is more than just entertainment. It is a part of our generation's culture. It has given us countless memories of building, exploring, and sometimes being unexpectedly defeated by a Creeper. We truly believe that Minecraft will continue to inspire future players just as much as it has inspired us.

    <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">Minecraft offers a wide range of content that shapes how players explore, build, and survive. From creatures and environments to building blocks and regular updates, each part adds to the endless possibilities of the game.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#1e8830; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">Mobs</h2>
    <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; margin-right: 750px;">Mobs are living entities that can be friendly, neutral, or hostile. <br>Friendly: cows, pigs, villagers and axolotls. <br> Neutral: endermen, wolves, bees. <br> Hostile: zombies, skeletons, creepers, and the Ender Dragon. <br> Each mob has unique behaviors that affect gameplay, such as trading, farming, or fighting.</p>

        <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; margin-right: 850px;">Minecraft receives regular updates that add new mechanics, mobs, biomes, and blocks. Major examples include the Nether Update, Caves & Cliffs, and the Wild Update.  These updates keep the game fresh and expand the ways players can explore and create.</p>
            <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; margin-right: 850px;">If you want to know more, we leave you this link to a Minecraft update's timeline, where you can see in more detail what was included in each update, along with its date of release.</p>

                   <img src="https://github.com/lucioooofacc/Proyecto-Software/blob/main/biomesyeah.png?raw=true" alt="biomes of minecraft" style="width:600px; height:300px; margin-right: 20px; float:left;">
       <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; margin-left: 600px; text-align:left;">Biomes are what make Minecraft's world feel alive. Think of them as the “flavors” of the game: each one has its own look, its own animals, and even its own personality.<br> Plains: Wide open and peaceful, the perfect place to build your first home. Cows, sheep, and horses wander around like neighbors waiting to be adopted.<br> Forest: Packed with trees, great for collecting wood. If you're lucky, you'll run into wolves you can tame and call your companions.<br> Desert: Hot and dangerous, but it hides secrets. Desert temples are like treasure chests waiting to be cracked open. Sand also becomes glass, so the desert is more useful than it looks.<br> Taiga: Cold, snowy forests with foxes and wolves sneaking around. The atmosphere here feels cozy and wild at the same time.<br> Jungle: Thick, wild, and full of surprises. You'll find parrots, ocelots, and massive temples hidden in the vines. It's beautiful but tricky to survive in.<br> Swamp: Muddy, dark, and spooky. Slimes hop around, and witches brew potions in huts (definitely not a place to settle down).<br> Ocean: Endless blue stretching in every direction. Shipwrecks, guardians, and treasure chests lie hidden beneath the waves.<br> Nether Biomes: Basalt Deltas, Crimson Forests, Warped Forests… the Nether is like Minecraft's version of the underworld. It's terrifying, fiery, and rewarding if you know how to survive.<br> The End: A surreal, empty void where floating islands hold End Cities and, of course, the Ender Dragon (the game's ultimate boss).<br> Biomes aren't just scenery; they decide what resources you'll get, how mobs behave, and what kind of adventure you'll have.</p>

       <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#1e8830; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">Blocks</h2>
              <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; margin-right:450px;">Blocks are the DNA of Minecraft. Everything you see, like land, buildings, and even enemies, is made of them. They're like digital Lego pieces you can use to create anything you imagine.<br><br>
Players use blocks to:<br>
Build: From tiny huts to entire kingdoms.<br>
Craft: Tools, armor, weapons, and farms.<br>
Decorate: Bright wool, colored terracotta, shiny glass.<br><br>
Some special blocks worth knowing:<br>
Obsidian: The toughest block you'll need for Nether portals.<br>
Diamond Block: Rare, shiny, and the ultimate bragging rights.<br>
Bedrock: Unbreakable in survival. It's literally the game's foundation.<br>
Redstone: Minecraft's electricity. It lets you build doors, traps, elevators, and even working computers if you're creative enough.</p>

That menu is divided into categories, so it's easier to search for a specific block.</p>

    <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">Well, if you are here, we assume that you already know how to get to the end, but if that isn't the case, don't worry; we are going to leave you a quick tutorial of how to get there.</p>

        <br>
    <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">To beat the Ender dragon, you first need to destroy the Ender Crystals that are on top of the obsidian pillars. These heal the dragon, so leaving them 
      intact makes the fight almost impossible. After destroying them (from the distance or from near but being careful), focus on attacking the dragon when it comes down to the bedrock fountain in the center of the island (literally x:0 and z:0). Use an axe to attack him when he perches and a bow to deal damage to her when its flying.</p>
      <br> 
       <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#1e8830; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">Protips to beat it like a speedrunner</h2>

     <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; margin-right: 600px;">-You have to take a lot of arrows with you and an enchanted bow (with power).<br>-You can take beds to kill the dragon; this happens because when you try to 
    sleep in the end, the bed explodes (like it happens in the nether), so if you know how to take advantage of the damage dealt by the beds, you can use it to kill the Enderdragon.<br> -If too many endermen are chasing you, you can put water on the floor, and you will stay safe. <br> -Enchant your armor with protection IV.</p>

Jumping into the portal triggers the End Poem, written by Julian Gough, followed by the credits of Minecraft.</p>

Minecraft's influence extends far beyond gaming, shaping education, pop culture, and even real-world entertainment. 
<br><b>Best-Seller & Big Business:</b> With over 300 million copies sold, Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time. Its immense cultural and economic value was recognized when Microsoft acquired Mojang in 2014 for $2.5 billion USD.
<br><b>Education Revolution:</b> The Minecraft: Education Edition is now a global learning tool used in schools to teach skills like coding, history, and teamwork. Its curriculum has expanded to foster cultural literacy, including interactive lessons on equity and justice (e.g., Black History Month 2025) and spotlighting narratives from indigenous community creators.
<br><b>Real-World Expansion:</b> Minecraft is moving from digital blocks to brick-and-mortar with a $110 million partnership with Merlin Entertainments. This deal will bring Minecraft-themed parks, attractions, and hotels to the UK and US, blending the virtual and physical worlds.
<br><b>Hollywood Blockbuster:</b> The upcoming A Minecraft Movie (2025), starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, has already made headlines. It surpassed the opening box office records of other video game films like Super Mario Bros., cementing Minecraft's position as a cultural phenomenon.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#1e8830; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">Revolutionary changes on social media</h2>
<p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:8px; display:inline-block;">
Minecraft's journey on social media has been nothing short of revolutionary. Once dismissed and mocked (players were often labeled as "rat kids" just for enjoying the game), today it stands as a cultural icon fully embraced by society.  
<br>
<b>The Rise, Fall & Cyclical Boom:</b> Minecraft has lived through unique cycles. After years of dominance, many considered it “dead,” only for it to return with an astronomical boom that felt like a brand-new release. This pattern has repeated over the years, turning its ups and downs into part of the game's identity and cultural legacy.  
<br><b>The 2 Week Phase:</b> A now-famous internet phenomenon describes how, at least once a year, countless players experience a “two-week phase” where they suddenly return to Minecraft, get completely hooked, and play obsessively before moving on—only to repeat the cycle again the next year.  
<br><b>Innovative Trends:</b> Social media platforms have been flooded with trends like “Minecraft but…” challenges, where creators twist the game's mechanics in funny or extreme ways. These clips often go viral, proving how adaptable the game is to internet humor and creativity.  
<br><b>Brand Collaborations:</b> Minecraft has collaborated with major global brands such as LEGO, UNIQLO, and Star Wars, extending its cultural footprint beyond gaming. These crossovers not only refresh its identity but also keep it relevant for new generations.  
<br><b>Series & Events:</b> Community-driven series and massive events have shattered viewership records on Twitch and YouTube. Dream SMP became a worldwide sensation, while in the Hispanic community, roleplay events like Karmaland, Tortillaland, and Egoland brought together legendary creators and drew millions of viewers. Competitions like Squid Craft Games and server-wide battles also turned Minecraft into a stage for historic online moments.  
<br><b>Controversies:</b> The game has been no stranger to drama. Famous examples include the Dream cheating scandal during his speedrun attempts, heated disputes inside Dream SMP, and even Mojang's controversial decision to add chat reporting in 2022, which divided the community. In the Hispanic scene, conflicts in events like Egoland and Squid Craft Games sparked massive debates on Twitch and Twitter.
